        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Thick, yet airy pancakes that are difficult to master. Adorn with fruit for a burst of flavor.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs, separated</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat egg whites in a medium sized bowl until stiff peaks form. The egg will be fluffy. Do not overbeat the eggs, as your pancake's fluffiness may be compromised!</li>
            <li>Add butter to your pan. Place molds in the pan over low heat. (These are either metal or silicone). Cover the pan.</li>
            <li>In a seperate bowl, mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda.</li>
            <li>In another seperate bowl, combine buttermilk, egg yolks, butter, and vanilla extract. Add flour mixture and then stir until batter is smooth.</li>
            <li>Fold egg whites into batter until combined.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/2 cup of batter into each mold and cover the pan. Cook until bubbles foam at top of pancake, around 5-8 minutes. Flip the pancakes in their molds (this part is tricky!) and cook until the pancakes are set, 3-5 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Top with syrup, fruit, or whatever you desire. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
