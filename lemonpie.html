        <p>A tried and true Southern classic, this delectable pie is no bake and perfect for serving on a hot summer day. Add Cool Whip or Whipped Cream on top for more goodness - but not meringue. As my momma's always said, that's just raw eggs!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>One can Eagle-brand Condensed Milk</li>
            <li>3 Whole Lemons (or 1/2 cup lemon juice)</li>
            <li>3 Egg Yolks</li>
            <li>One Graham Cracker Pie Pan (Or alternatively make your own)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Roll lemons by hand until they are soft. Skip this step if you are not using fresh lemons.</li>
            <li>Juice the lemons using a lemon squeezer or by squeezing them by hand. Remove any seeds. Again, skip this step if you're not using fresh lemons!</li>
            <li>Separate egg whites from egg yolks.</li>
            <li>In a medium sized bowl, mix egg yolks and condensed milk. Gradually **VERY SLOWLY** add lemon juice. Adding the lemon juice too quickly can ruin the mixture.</li>
            <li>Chill overnight. It should be done within 6 hours.</li>
            <li>Add whipped cream or cool whip if so desired. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
